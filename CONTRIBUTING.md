## Contributing

### Requirements

#### Mac or Linux OS
I've only worked on this on a mac. I think it'll work on linux but not 100% sure.
For windows, I have no idea if it works but I haven't tried!

#### Haskell
Ideally be confident and proficient working in haskell. If you're new to haskell, please
don't be discouraged from contributing. Any PR I'm happy to look at and iterate on!

Also you need haskell and stack installed. Since we use stack, you don't have to worry
about which version of haskell because stack takes care of all of that.

### Deciding what to work on

I'm going to try to udpate the github issues with what good areas to contribute too. I'll try
to keep the issues specific as to what the end goal is. If you poke around and see something
that you think can be improved, feel free to work on that as well. Anything to improve this
codebase is a welcome change.

Additionally, I'll try to create and manage issues for what I'm working on as well, to avoid
doing duplicate work. If you have a question about if something already exists or a feature,
please open and issue and we can dicusss and find a path forward.

A few general notes on contributing.

- Try to avoid adding new dependencies unless it's really necessary
- The types in haskell do a good job doing simple self-documenting, however if something you're
working on is counter-intuitive then please add comments explaining why you're doing what you're
doing
